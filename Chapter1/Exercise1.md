One way to measure the amount of energy that is expended during exercise is to use metabolic equivalents (MET). Here are some METS for various activities: Running 6 MPH: 10 METS

Basketball: 8 METS

Sleeping: 1 MET

The number of calories burned per minute may be estimated using the following formula:

 in kilograms

Write a program that calculates and outputs the total number of calories burned for a 150-pound person who runs 6 MPH for 30 minutes, plays basketball for 30 minutes, and then sleeps for 6 hours. One kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds.
